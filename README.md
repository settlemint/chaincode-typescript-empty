# Hyperledger Fabric Empty Smart Contract Set

An empty Hyperledger Fabric smart contract set using Typescript.

## Get started

Launch this smart contract set in the SettleMint Blockchain Transformation platform under the `Smart Contract Sets` section. This will automatically link it to your own blockchain node and make use of the private keys living in the platform.

You will find all the commands to get your smart contract up and running in the `Task Manager`.
